In the early 80's, I was a young teen-ager. It was a time when some of my
friends had Commodore 64s and Apple IIs, and I had an
[IBM PC 8088](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer).  At the time, I thought I was "missing out"
because there weren't a lot of games for the IBM. But then I was thumbing
through an issue of [PC
Mag](https://archive.org/search?query=subject%3A%22PC+Mag%22) and it had a
listing for a program in BASIC.  I can't remember what the program did now, but
I remember thinking I had found a secret tunnel into the inside of the computer.
Since then I have always loved programming.  Well to be honest, after a few
years of loving it, I left it behind because I thought I wanted to be a rock
star or a baseball player... Until my mid-twenties.
