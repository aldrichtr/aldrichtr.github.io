This is my first public post.  I intend to use this space for documenting
and discussing my personal projects.  Over the next few posts, I'll try to lay out
the general subject matter and develop a workflow / schedule for publishing content.

Right now, the general tools are github pages, github actions and hugo.  I am currently using Markdown
as the source format, but I've been a long time user of the amazing
[org mode](https://orgmode.org) format, and I see that hugo supports that as well.
