            </div>What is &ldquo;Infrastructure Testing&rdquo; In my own words, infrastructure testing is:
validating that a configuration item is the value that you expect it to be.
For example:
Is the Operating System Windows Server? Is the DNS service running? Is the count of members of the local &lsquo;Administrators&rsquo; group 3? As a sysadmin, these are things that I would check on as part of my daily operations tasks, and also things that I would check on during troubleshooting.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
