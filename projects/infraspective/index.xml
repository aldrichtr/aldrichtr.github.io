What is &amp;ldquo;Infrastructure Testing&amp;rdquo; In my own words, infrastructure testing is:
validating that a configuration item is the value that you expect it to be.
For example:
Is the Operating System Windows Server? Is the DNS service running? Is the count of members of the local &amp;lsquo;Administrators&amp;rsquo; group 3? As a sysadmin, these are things that I would check on as part of my daily operations tasks, and also things that I would check on during troubleshooting.</description></item></channel></rss>
