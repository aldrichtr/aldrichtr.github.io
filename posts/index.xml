            </div>What is &ldquo;Infrastructure Testing&rdquo; In my own words, infrastructure testing is:
validating that a configuration item is the value that you expect it to be.
For example:
Is the Operating System Windows Server? Is the DNS service running? Is the count of members of the local &lsquo;Administrators&rsquo; group 3? As a sysadmin, these are things that I would check on as part of my daily operations tasks, and also things that I would check on during troubleshooting.]]></description></item><item><title>"Hello World" | Set-Content blog</title><link>https://aldrichtr.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://aldrichtr.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>This is my first public post. I intend to use this space for documenting and discussing my personal projects. Over the next few posts, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to lay out the general subject matter and develop a workflow / schedule for publishing content.
Right now, the general tools are github pages, github actions and hugo. I am currently using Markdown as the source format, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long time user of the amazing org mode format, and I see that hugo supports that as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
